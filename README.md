# Personal Profile Page - 3MTT HTML Basics Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a personal profile page, created as an assignment for the 3MTT (3 Million Technical Talent) program, powered by Darey.io. This project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce fundamental HTML concepts and showcase basic web development skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Personal-Profile-Page/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the profile page
├── img1.jpg          # Profile picture or relevant image
└── README.md         # This documentation file
```

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Used for the structure and content of the webpage.

## Assignment Details

This project was designed to fulfill the 3MTT program's HTML basics module requirements. The goal was to create a simple yet functional personal profile page, demonstrating:

* Proper use of HTML tags and semantics for structure and content.
* Inclusion of an image.
* Basic page layout.

## How to View the Profile Page

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    * Use the following command in your terminal or Git Bash to clone the repository to your local machine:

        ```
        git clone [https://github.com/preshengr/personalprofile]
        ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    * Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your file explorer.
    * Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser.

3.  **View the Page:**
    * The personal profile page will be displayed in your browser.

## Content and Structure of `index.html`

The `index.html` file contains the following elements:

* **`<head>` Section:**
    * Includes the `<title>` tag to set the page title.
    * May include `<meta>` tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
    * May include `<style>` tags or `<link>` tags for basic CSS styling (if any was added).
* **`<body>` Section:**
    * Contains the main content of the profile page.
    * Uses headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure information.
    * Includes paragraphs (`<p>`) for descriptive text.
    * Displays the profile image using the `<img>` tag, referencing `img1.jpg`.
    * May include lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for listing skills or achievements.
    * May include links (`<a>`) to other online profiles.
    * May include divisions (`<div>`) or sections (`<section>`) to group content.

## Image (`img1.jpg`)

* The `img1.jpg` file is the image used in the profile page.
* Ensure that the image is placed in the same directory as `index.html`.
* The image should be of reasonable file size.
